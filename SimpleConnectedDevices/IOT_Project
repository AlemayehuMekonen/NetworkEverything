A simple Web-based emotion boosting LED Device.

There will be 4 different colored LED which display 4 different colores based on the emotion felt by the user and play 4 different musics 
which corspond to each feeling to boost the mood of the user. Forexample, if the user feels stressed and he send a signal which activates red LED color, 
then the device sends back a stress reliefing music to the user to listen.
I will use an arduino, java script files and html to build the device
